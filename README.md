# Trade Policy Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB code and data to replicate the numerical results in
Ossa (2014), *Trade Wars and Trade Talks with Data*.

## Cleanup

Temporary duplicates of tables and programs were stored in `Tables/Temp/`.
These copied `.mat` and `.m` files mirrored existing resources and created
maintenance overhead, so the directory has been removed. The main `Tables/`
folder now hosts the canonical versions.
